                An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label given to each device that uses Internet Protocol to communicate. The Internet currently uses a version of Internet Protocol called IPv4. IPv4 addresses are made up of 32 bits, allowing for 4.29 billion unique addresses. Although 4.29 billion seems like a lot, we are actually nearing this limit. A new version of the Internet Protocol is being developed, called IPv6, which will utilize 128-bit addresses, allowing for 340 undecillion unique addresses. It will be a few years before IPv6 will be ready for use.
            </p>
            <p>
                When data is sent from one device to another, it is transmitted as a packet. A packet is a segment of data that is sent from one place to another. A packet includes the source, destination, data contents, size and other information that helps the packet arrive at its destination. When you send a large message, your message can be divided into multiple packets, which are then reassembled into one message once they reach the destination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before packets arrive at their destination, they need to pass through many routers, which are computers that act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving smoothly. Given how expansive the Internet network is, there are multiple paths a packet can take to get to its destination. Routers decide which path is most suitable for the packet and send it to the next router until the packet arrives at its destination. Having multiple path options means that the Internet is fault tolerant, so if one area of the network is not working, there are still other paths available to the packets. Fault tolerance makes the Internet reliable. Since more routers provide more path options, the more routers added to a network, the more reliable it becomes.
